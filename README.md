[How to Write  Useful Commit Messages](https://dev.to/jacobherrington/how-to-write-useful-commit-messages-my-commit-message-template-20n9)

Here is an example:

```plain text
Refactor the coupon UI

Because:
- The old UI code is fairly slow
- There were a few unused dependencies
- The old UI has aged poorly
```

For sure, it is a template, the second paragraph is not required if just a simple message

git commit -a -m '<Short summary of the commit>' -m '<Explaination if needed>'
```
